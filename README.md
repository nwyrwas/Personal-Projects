# 👋 Welcome to My Project Showcase – Nick Wyrwas

This repository is a curated collection of my personal and academic projects, organized by difficulty level and scope. It demonstrates my progression as a developer — from foundational frontend apps to advanced AI tools and full-stack systems using modern frameworks like Django and React.

Each folder below represents a category of projects with detailed descriptions of the work inside. Feel free to explore and dive into the code!

## 🟢 Easy

### 📝 Simple To-Do List Web App
**Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Project Goal:** Build a beginner-friendly web application to understand the basics of frontend development and DOM manipulation.

This project helps new developers understand how the core web technologies work together. The app allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks from a clean and responsive interface. Key features include:

- Form input validation
- Button interactivity and input feedback
- CSS animations (like a shake effect on invalid input)
- Responsive layout using flexbox

### 🧮 Smart Calculator App
**Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Canvas, DOM, Math Logic)  
**Project Goal:** Create an interactive calculator that supports basic arithmetic and visual calculus features such as graph plotting and symbolic differentiation.

This is a feature-rich beginner project designed to bridge core JavaScript fundamentals with early interactive UI concepts. Highlights include:

- Basic calculator operations (+, −, ×, ÷)
- Theme toggle (light/dark mode)
- Mode switch between standard and calculus features
- Basic symbolic differentiation and integration logic
- Function graphing using HTML5 Canvas
- Modern UI with CSS animations and a floating bubble background

## 🔴 Advanced

### 🤖 AI-Powered Research Assistant Agent
**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenAI API  
**Project Goal:** Create a smart assistant that helps users draft research papers using natural language processing and AI text generation.

This project simulates a real-world academic tool where users can input a research topic and receive:

- Topic-specific outlines
- Writing prompts and paragraph suggestions
- Support for narrowing or expanding ideas

The agent is trained to maintain academic tone and structure, ideal for students and researchers. It's built with extensibility in mind, enabling future integration with citation APIs or document formatting tools.

### 💬 Self-Learning Support Chatbot
**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenAI API, Flask  
**Project Goal:** Build an interactive chatbot that guides users through self-learning journeys, answering questions and recommending resources based on users goals.

This project acts as a virtual study companion, helping users identify learning objectives, track progress, and overcome obstacles in real time. Users can interact with the chatbot to:

- Receive personalized study plans and resource recommendations
- Ask questions and get instant explanations or clarifications
- Set goals and track learning milestones
- Get motivational tips and reminders

The chatbot is designed for students, professionals, and lifelong learners. It’s built to be easily extended with new subject modules or integrated with external learning platforms in the future.

## 🌐 Full-Stack

This section is divided into two subfolders to highlight frontend and backend development skills used in creating complete, deployable applications.


### 📦 Back-End

**Tech Stack:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework, SQLite/PostgreSQL  
**Project Goal:** Design scalable backend systems with user management, API endpoints, and secure data handling.

Projects in this folder focus on:

- Creating and manipulating databases with Django ORM
- Building RESTful APIs for web or mobile use
- Role-based authentication and user access control
- Admin panel customization for real-world admin tasks

One highlighted project includes a Django-based restaurant reservation and menu system, with models for users, orders, and menus.

### 🎨 Front-End

**Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS  
**Project Goal:** Build responsive, interactive, and modern UIs for web applications.

This folder includes:

- A personal developer **portfolio website** with responsive design, project showcase, and contact form.
- **React projects** demonstrating use of state management, component-based architecture, and routing.

Projects aim to reflect real-world frontend workflows and feature:

- Clean, reusable components
- SPA (Single Page Application) structure with React Router
- Modern UI styling with Tailwind for faster prototyping

## 🚧 Future Plans

I'm actively developing more projects in this repo, including:

- Machine learning experiments
- Mobile app development with Kotlin or React Native outside of school projects
- DevOps workflows with Docker and CI/CD pipelines
